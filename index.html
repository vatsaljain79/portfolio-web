			<h2>Mastering Competitive Programming - Strategy</h2>
			<div class="modal-body">

				<p>
					Competitive programming is not about sudden brilliance; it is about consistent improvement over
					time.
					The right strategy focuses on practice, patience, and learning from every contest and problem you
					attempt.
				</p>

				<h3>Practice and Practice</h3>
				<p>
					The most important rule of competitive programming is simple - practice regularly. Problem-solving
					skills develop only through continuous exposure to different types of questions. The more problems
					you solve, the stronger your intuition and pattern recognition become.
				</p>

				<h3>Consistency is the Key</h3>
				<p>
					Consistency matters more than solving many problems occasionally. Even small daily practice sessions
					help maintain momentum and gradually improve speed and accuracy. Long-term consistency leads to
					significant improvement.
				</p>

				<h3>Participate in Contests Frequently</h3>
				<p>
					Try to give as many contests as possible across different platforms. Competing regularly helps
					optimize
					your time management, improves thinking under pressure, and exposes you to diverse problem styles.
				</p>

				<h3>Do Not Feel Low After Bad Contests</h3>
				<p>
					Not every contest will go well, and that is completely normal. Poor performances are part of the
					learning
					process. Instead of getting discouraged, analyze mistakes and stay consistent with practice.
				</p>

				<h3>Learn from Unsolved Problems</h3>
				<p>
					If you are unable to solve a question during practice, spend time understanding its tutorial or
					editorial.
					If a new concept appears, make sure you understand it properly and remember the approach so that you
					can
					solve similar problems independently in the future.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Practice regularly and stay consistent.</li>
					<li>Participate in contests on multiple platforms.</li>
					<li>Do not get discouraged by bad performances.</li>
					<li>Learn actively from editorials and new concepts.</li>
					<li>Focus on long-term improvement rather than short-term results.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Internship Interview Day at IIT Delhi - Aug 3, 2024 | Day 1</h2>

			<div class="modal-body">

				<p>
					Before Day 1 of internship interviews, I was shortlisted for almost all company Online Assessments,
					and after the OAs, I had shortlists from more than 10 companies scheduled for Day 1.
					It felt exciting - but also extremely overwhelming.
				</p>

				<h3>The Day Begins - 6:00 AM</h3>
				<p>
					Day 1 started early at 6 AM on August 3rd with my first interview at
					<strong>Graviton</strong> for the ULL role. Unfortunately, I could not perform
					at my best in Round 1 itself and got eliminated. It was not the start I had hoped for,
					but the day had only just begun.
				</p>

				<p>
					Next came two rounds of interviews with <strong>Millennium</strong> followed by three
					rounds with <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>. Later, I also received an interview call from
					<strong>DE Shaw</strong>. Although my interviews with Goldman Sachs and Millennium went well,
					I was not selected.
				</p>

				<p>
					By 12 PM, Slot 1 was over - multiple interviews completed, but no offer in hand.
					I felt disappointed and honestly a bit depressed. However, I knew the most important
					thing at that moment was to stay calm and prepare for Slot 2 starting at 3 PM.
				</p>

				<h3>Slot 2 - The Long Evening</h3>
				<p>
					The second half of the day began with an interview at <strong>Adobe Research</strong>,
					followed by Round 1 and Round 2 interviews with <strong>Atlassian</strong>.
					Later, I received a call from <strong>Samsung Korea</strong>, where after three rounds,
					I was placed on the offer waitlist.
				</p>

				<p>
					Then came three rounds with <strong>Barclays</strong>, where again I was placed on the
					offer waitlist. Around 8:30 PM, after most companies had finalized selections, I started
					an interview with <strong>QRT</strong>. I cleared Round 1 but was rejected after Round 2.
				</p>

				<p>
					After an entire day filled with interviews, I still had no offer.
					I returned to my hostel feeling completely exhausted and mentally drained.
				</p>

				<h3>The Night</h3>
				<p>
					A friend came to my room and asked whether I had eaten anything.
					I realized I had not eaten since morning. We went to the canteen together,
					had dinner, and I finally went to sleep reminding myself that I still had
					interviews scheduled for the next day - more than five shortlists waiting.
				</p>

				<p>
					Despite everything, I believed that whatever happens, happens for a reason.
				</p>

				<h3>The Morning That Changed Everything</h3>
				<p>
					The next morning, I woke up at 5 AM and checked my phone.
					There was a message from the OCS team:
				</p>

				<p><strong>“You have been selected by Atlassian. Congratulations!”</strong></p>

				<p>
					That moment is impossible to describe in words - the contrast between a hopeless
					night and a clear, hopeful morning. All the stress, uncertainty, and emotions
					of the previous day suddenly made sense.
				</p>

				<h3>Final Thought</h3>
				<p>
					Life does not always reward you immediately. Sometimes you go through failures,
					rejections, and long exhausting days before things fall into place.
					Just believe in yourself, stay patient, and keep moving forward.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Rejections are temporary.</li>
					<li>Consistency and calmness matter under pressure.</li>
					<li>Every experience prepares you for the right opportunity.</li>
					<li>Whatever happens eventually works out for the best.</li>
				</ul>

			<h2>Placement Interview Day - Dec 1, 2025 | Day 1</h2>

			<div class="modal-body">

				<p>
					Before Day 1 of placements, I had already completed all three interview rounds with
					<strong>Databricks</strong>. The interviews went well, but unfortunately I was not selected
					- possibly because of my CGPA (8.8). Around the same time, I had also completed
					Round 1 and Round 2 with <strong>Squarepoint</strong>, both of which went extremely well.
					With strong hopes, I entered Day 1 on December 1st.
				</p>

				<h3>6:00 AM - The Day Begins</h3>
				<p>
					The morning started early with Round 3 at <strong>Squarepoint</strong> for a Software
					Developer position. Unfortunately, the interview did not go as expected. Without much
					time to think, I immediately moved to my next interview at <strong>DE Shaw</strong>.
				</p>

				<p>
					I had two rounds there, but later I was informed that they were moving forward with
					other candidates. Soon after, I headed to <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, where I faced
					three back-to-back interviews. After completing all rounds, I was placed on the
					waitlist.
				</p>

				<p>
					By 11:30 AM, multiple interviews were done - yet I still had no offer in hand.
					The pressure and uncertainty were real, but the day was not over yet.
				</p>

				<h3>The Turning Point</h3>
				<p>
					I then moved to <strong>JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMC)</strong>. After another series of
					three consecutive interview rounds, the moment finally arrived - I received an offer.
				</p>

				<p>
					That feeling is impossible to fully describe. The joy, relief, and satisfaction of
					finally being placed after continuous interviews and uncertainty made every effort
					worth it. All the preparation, failures, and persistence finally paid off.
				</p>

				<h3>Final Reflection</h3>
				<p>
					Placement journeys test not only your technical skills but also your patience,
					mental strength, and belief in yourself. Rejections are temporary, but persistence
					eventually leads you to the right opportunity.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Every rejection teaches something valuable.</li>
					<li>Stay calm even when things don’t go your way.</li>
					<li>Trust your preparation and keep moving forward.</li>
					<li>Your moment will come - sometimes when you least expect it.</li>
